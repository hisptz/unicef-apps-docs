### Legend Configurations

The user can modify the legend based on the number of stages for tracking the
action status. Currently the Action Tracker has 5 colour codes which indicate
the levels through which the actions are tracked; white indicates “Action not
started”, Olive indicates “In Progress”, Pink indicates “Constrained”, Green
indicated “Completed”, Red indicates the action was “Discontinued.”
