# Capacity building

## National Core Team (NCT)

The National core team will need all the necessary skills (M&E, Data and ICT teams) to support BNA app implementation and bottleneck analysis in general. Both BNA app end-user and technical skills will be required in this case.

1. **_User skills_**: Ability to generate, analysis and interpret BNA charts, enter root causes for identified gaps, etc
2. **_Technical Skills:_** know how to setup BNA indicators on charts, configure user access and sharing

## Training strategies and preparations

1. **_National Core Team engagement:_** The national core team should be prepared to offer continuous training to both national and district level users in accordance with BNA implementation guidelines.

    The core team should routinely review, identify and share the feedback on BNA app use cases with the development teams at HISP and UiO.

2. **_Customization of training materials:_** Training material and reference guides to reflect local information needs and local system content should be adopted. The core team should play a key role in ensuring training materials are up-to-date and conform to the country standards.
3. **_Development of implementation materials: _** Materials for the BNA implementation should be reviewed and developed by the national core team. These may include the Implementation guide, end-user and administrators guide. Were necessary, step-by-step guides should also be developed to enhance the training sessions.
4. **_User acceptance testing:_** This training is aimed at field testing the features and functions of the BNA app. The training can be organised into two categories of users, administrators and end-users. The purpose is to gauge the ability of users to interact with the app and use it for bna analysis.
5. **_Training of Trainers:_** Part of the processes to build capacity for support and implementation of BNA is putting in place a national core team. The ToT is aimed at training and building the capacity of a national core team to support BNA configuration and use at both national and lower levels. A team of 5-10 professional staff should be identified, trained and equipped to support the implementation.

## End User training

Important tasks to note for the end user training are the roles and responsibilities of various users who will interact with the BNA App. These will depend on two factors, what the person will be doing, and where the user is located.

1. **_Identify required training: _** The most common tasks required for BNA app training will include, Data analysis processing, preparing reports and other information products. The development team should endeavour to work with stakeholders (MoH and Unicef) to plan trainings that have an impact on the users. App  maintenance - managing users, changes on indicators and data elements.
2. **_Workshops and onsite training: _** 1-2 workshops should be organised and conducted in an effort to support BNA app implementation. a) Workshop for indicator  identification and mapping, b) Training and capacity building workshop during implementation. Additionally, for lower levels such as facilities, on-site training sessions should be conducted to facilitate hands-on exercises. The on-site training sessions should be decentralized and preferably conducted by the District Health Management Team (DHMT) in conjunction with the MoH
3. **_Focused groups training: _** Focused group trainings on use of BNA app should be adopted to allow maximum benefit for the participants. Sub-national level meetings such District Committee, District Health Management meetings should serve as avenues to discuss bottlenecks and mitigation approaches.
4. **_Mentorship and support supervision:_** Six-monthly onsite support supervision and training on the use of BNA app should be planned and conducted. This will help identify gaps in the BNA app implementation process and generate actions.
