# Planning and organising

**_Stakeholders:_** It is important to identify the stakeholders who will
participate in the implementation of BNA App and associated activities.
Key stakeholders may include but not limited to the Ministry of Health,
district staff, UNICEF staff, development and implementing partners

**_BNA Core Team (BCT):_** 3-5 people will need to be identified and given the
roles and responsibilities of administering the bottleneck analysis app. The
core team (ICT and data analysis proficient) support setup and configuration
will participate in testing and training activities, organizing and supporting
end-user in various groups.

**_Technical Steering Committee:_** A committee composed of MoH and UNICEF will
 be needed to coordinate the BNA implementation across various health programs
 (Malaria, nutrition, reproductive health etc). The committee will lead
 integration of DHIS2 with other legacy systems ( Human resources Systems,
   LAB systems and Logistics)  and make decisions regarding the overall
   architecture and functioning of the BNA app.

**_Identifying users:_** Users of the BNA app should be cross-cutting from
program managers at the national level to district and facility users at lower
levels of implementation.  To organize BNA implementation, it is important to
group the users for easy management and assigning system privileges. Some
examples of user groups include National users, District Users, Facility Users.
