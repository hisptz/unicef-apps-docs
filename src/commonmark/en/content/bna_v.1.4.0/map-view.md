Root Cause analysis

After the district user has looked at the Bottleneck Analysis Chart and the Sublevel Analysis Chart and has identified the major bottlenecks, they are expected to proceed to Root Cause Analysis Widget.In the root cause analysis widget they can document the Root causes and Solutions of determinants and indicators for the active intervention based on the period and organization unit filters applied.

At first glance the widget will come up empty and the user can create a new empty row by simply clicking the “Add New” button.A pop up form will show up where a user will be required to select the bottleneck and Indicator from a dropdown list and use free text to document the possible root cause and possible solution.Once done there is a save button in the bottom right of the pop up form to save the details.

The quality of the causality analysis is a critical determinant of the quality of the resulting plans and the impact on health system performance.It is important to have around the table people with the right knowledge and expertise.

Once a bottleneck is identified,the root causes need to be thoroughly assessed

It is important to know what to look for when facilitating a root cause analysis.

1. Common causes of bottlenecks in the health system (specific for each determinant)

2. Main environmental factors (Social Norms,Legislation/Policy, Budget/expenditure,Management/Coordination)

3. Possible crisis/hazards (if relevant)

Once identified, proposed solutions/ actions need to be documented for follow-up and implementation.
