    1.Layer type: this provides two options:

        a)Choropleth: A map layer that uses difference in colors or shading to represent data.

        b)Bubble: A map layer that uses circular figures (bubbles) to represent data. The data is represented by the size of the bubble and the color

    2.Boundary layer: User has the option to enable or disable the default display of the boundary layer. Enabling the boundary layer will ensure the boundary layer is visible on the map by default. The view can be toggled by the layer control on the map at any time.

    3.Facility layer: User has the option to enable or disable the default display of the facility layer. Enabling the facility layer will enable the facility layer to be visible by default.

    The icon settings allow the user to select which icons should represent the facilities within the map. The custom icon selection allows the user to select one icon which will represent all facilities on the map. Group set icons allow the user to select a pre-configured organization unit group set from DHIS2 configuration which groups the organization units (facilities) and assigns an icon to them.
