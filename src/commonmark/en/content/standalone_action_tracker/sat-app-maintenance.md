Accessing interface for clearing browser cache can be done via the following approaches:	

* **Google chrome**​: Go to the menu icon on the top right corner, and click it to open, go to the more tools menu, and choose “Clear browsing data”. Once the interface is open, Make sure, “Clear the following items from” is set to “The beginning of time”.
* **Mozilla Firefox​**: Go to the menu icon on the top right corner, and click it to open, go to ->Library, and go to History, and choose “Clear recent history”. Once the interface is open, Make sure “Time range to clear” is set to “Everything”, and the “Details” option is expanded to show all details options.
