# Navigating the Standalone Action Tracker App

Standalone Action Tracker App can be found in the Apps menu. if the application has not yet been installed in your DHIS2 instance or installation has issues, refer to the installation instructions (Chapter 2) of this documentation for further guidance, or contact the DHIS2 administrator for your instance.

## Using global filters


### Organization units selection

The Standalone Action Tracker App allows the user to make organization unit selections based on implementation levels.

**Note:**
* The options for organization units’ selection will be limited based on the user's account. Standalone action tracker app inherits DHIS2’s configurations including user’s predefined locations when his/her account was created/

![Figure 4.2.5-A: Selection of orgunits](resources/images/image302.png)

![Figure 4.2.5-B: Selection of orgunits](resources/images/image303.png)


**Note:** Selection of the organization units should be aligned with the allowable planning level


### Period selection

The Standalone Action Tracker App allows users to make period selections for fixed periods, relative periods and extended relative periods.

All period selection types begin with clicking the period button on the global filters menu. Then clicking on the period type select option button which lists all the period types.

**Note:** Users should only select a period as per allowable planning cycle for the selected organization unit level. For example, if planning is done annually, then users should select years. The Standalone Action Tracker app has included a reminder of allowable period selection

![Figure 3.2.4: Period type selection](resources/images/image304.png)

####  Fixed period selections 

To select fixed periods, start by selecting a period type from the period type list. You can then select periods from the list of available periods.

![Figure 3.2.4.1: Fixed period selections](resources/images/image305.png)

####  Relative period selections 

To select relative periods start by selecting a period type from the period type list. You can then select periods from the list of available periods.

## Actions planning

The first part of using the standalone action tracker allows users to document actions related to plans that they have done. Users will be able to use this section to define interventions, manage indicators and assignment of responsible entities for each action documented.


###  Managing intervention

Defining an intervention is the first step for tracking actions. Before users can define what action needs to be taken, they have to define the intervention they want to focus on. Definition of interventions allows creation of linkage of actions to be tracked with indicators. Linking interventions with indicators will allow users to be able to easily track impact of their actions (as indicators performance improves or worsen).


#### Adding intervention

To define an intervention whose corresponding actions should be tracked, the user should click on Add intervention tab. User can provide a description of the intervention to be tracked and select corresponding indicators.

![Figure 3.2.1.1-A: Option for adding new intervention](resources/images/image307.png)


![Figure 3.2.1.1-B: Initiating definition of intervention to be tracked](resources/images/image308.png)

![Figure 3.2.1.1-C: Describing and selecting indicators for the intervention to be tracked.](resources/images/image309.png)


#### Managing intervention

To update existing intervention, click on the menu item highlighted below to access options for editing and/or deleting intervention.

![Figure 3.2.1.2-A: Accessing option for editing or deleting intervention](resources/images/image310.png)

To edit an intervention click on Edit option then update the intervention details on the pop-up window then click Save Intervention

![Figure 3.2.1.2-B: Accessing option for editing or deleting intervention](resources/images/image311.png)


To delete intervention click on Delete option the click deletion confirmation button

![Figure 3.2.1.2-C: Confirmation pop-up for deleting an intervention.](resources/images/image312.png)

### Managing bottlenecks

This is the second step for action planning. For each intervention that the user has defined, he/she has to outline the bottlenecks identified.


#### Adding bottleneck

To define a bottleneck whose corresponding actions should be tracker, user should click on Add bottleneck tab. 

![Figure 3.2.2.1-A: Option for adding new bottleneck](resources/images/image313.png)

Users can provide the bottleneck title, description and select the method that was used to identify the bottleneck to be registered. Upon completion of bottleneck definition, user should click Save Bottleneck

![Figure 3.2.2.1-B: Selection of method used to identify the bottleneck](resources/images/image315.png)


**Note:** Methods to be selected here should be first be added by the administrative user


#### Managing bottleneck

To update existing bottleneck, click on the menu item highlighted below to access options for editing and/or deleting details.

![Figure 3.2.2.2-A: Accessing option for editing or deleting bottleneck](resources/images/image316.png)

To delete bottleneck click on Delete option the click deletion confirmation button

![Figure 3.2.2.2-B: Confirmation pop-up for deleting a bottleneck.](resources/images/image318.png)

### Managing solutions

For each intervention and bottleneck identified, user will define possible solutions to address the bottlenecks.


#### Adding solution

To define a possible solution whose corresponding actions should be tracked, user should click on Add solution tab. 

![Figure 3.2.3.1-A: Option for adding potential solution](resources/images/image319.png)

User can provide the solution description. Upon completion of bottleneck definition, user should click Save Solution

![Figure 3.2.3.1-B: Completing details for potential solution to be added](resources/images/image320.png)

#### Managing solutions

To update existing solutions, click on the menu item highlighted below to access options for editing and/or deleting details.
