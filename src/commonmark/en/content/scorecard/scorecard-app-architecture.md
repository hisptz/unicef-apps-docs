# Scorecard App architecture

The Scorecard Application is built on an architecture that eases the user interactions by having a design concept that promotes the user to follow their intuition complemented with high performance that considers the lowest internet connection scenarios with descriptive notification messages if the user misses a step along the way.

## Global DHIS2 Menu

When using the Scorecard App the Global DHIS2 Menu is accessible in its usual position. The user can use the global menu to access other apps and to log out of the system. Most of the app notifications will pop on the top position where the DHIS2 global menu exists.
