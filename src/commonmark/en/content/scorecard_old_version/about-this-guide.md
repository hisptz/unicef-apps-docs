## About this guide

The scorecard Application is a collective effort and has been developed by the development team and expected users. The Implementation guide is the document that aims to guide users with administrative privilege on to set up the scorecard and share access with other users within the system for usage. While the guide strives to be complete, there may be certain functionalities that have been omitted or which have yet to be documented. This section explains some of the conventions which are used throughout the document.
The Scorecard App is deployed in the DHIS2 platform and has been uploaded into the DHIS2 play store, for users to easily install in their DHIS2 systems. In many cases, screenshots have been included for enhanced clarity. Shortcuts to various functionalities are displayed such as Data element > Data element group. The ">" symbol indicates that you should click the Data element and then click the Data element group in the user interface. Different styles of text have been used to highlight important parts of the text or particular types of text, such as source code. Each of the conventions used in the document are explained below.
